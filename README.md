# Wellcome to Thulera's Store!

Wellcome to this project! Thuler's Store is a website HTML, CSS. Bootstrap and PHP based wich I made in 2020, when I was on the 2nd grade of highschool. 

You can access the result by clicking [here](https://thulera-sstore.000webhostapp.com/)

As you can see, this website has a little more features and is better developed than the previous one (Jojosite). For example, this website is resposible, so it adapts to each screen size of any device and it also has a seach-bar feature, some back-end resources, but it's still quite rudimentary for a webstore, cause there's no databank, no sign in / sign up functions, etc., but I'm doing my best and getting beter.
